1. Results
1.1 Baseline Model Performance

Linear regression–based models were first evaluated to establish interpretable baselines. Table X summarizes their predictive performance.

Key observation:
All linear models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) achieved similar performance, with an RMSE of approximately 6.46 MPa and an R² of 0.71, indicating that linear relationships explain a substantial portion of the variance but fail to capture more complex patterns present in the data.

Interpretation:
This result suggests that while compressive strength is partially governed by linear effects (e.g., binder content), nonlinear interactions among mix parameters play a significant role.

1.2 Tree-Based and Ensemble Model Performance

Table Y presents the performance of tree-based and ensemble models.

Decision Tree models significantly reduced prediction error compared to linear baselines.

Random Forest further improved stability and accuracy.

Gradient Boosting achieved the best overall performance, with an RMSE of 2.94 MPa and an R² of 0.94.

Performance gain summary:
Compared to linear models, ensemble methods reduced RMSE by more than 50%, demonstrating their superior ability to model nonlinear relationships and feature interactions inherent in concrete mix design.

Notably, the consistent improvement from Decision Tree → Random Forest → Gradient Boosting reflects a healthy bias–variance trade-off, suggesting that the observed gains are not due to overfitting.

2. Interpretability Analysis

While ensemble models are often criticized for reduced transparency, this study evaluates interpretability through multiple complementary approaches.

2.1 Linear Model Coefficients

Linear regression coefficients indicate that:

Binder content has a strong positive effect on compressive strength.

Water and foaming agent exhibit negative effects, consistent with increased porosity and higher water–binder ratios.

Pozzolan contribution appears minimal within the linear regime.

These findings align closely with established concrete engineering principles, reinforcing the validity of the dataset and modeling setup.

2.2 Feature Importance in Ensemble Models

To assess interpretability in nonlinear models, two feature importance methods were employed:

Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDG) from Random Forests

Permutation Importance (MDA), a model-agnostic approach

Both methods consistently identified the same dominant features:

Binder content

Fine aggregate content

Measured density

Water and foaming agent

Pozzolan (least influential)

Crucially, the strong agreement between MDG and MDA mitigates known biases associated with impurity-based importance measures and strengthens confidence in the interpretability results.

2.3 Consistency Across Models

A key finding of this study is the consistency of feature importance rankings across linear, tree-based, and ensemble models.

Despite substantial differences in model complexity and predictive performance:

Dominant features remain stable

Directional effects remain physically meaningful

No contradictions with domain knowledge are observed

This consistency indicates that improved performance does not come at the expense of interpretability.

3. Performance–Interpretability Trade-Off

The results highlight a nuanced trade-off between predictive accuracy and model transparency:

Linear models offer direct interpretability but limited accuracy

Ensemble models substantially improve performance while preserving meaningful interpretability through feature importance analysis

Importantly, ensemble models do not introduce spurious or unintuitive relationships, suggesting their suitability for engineering applications where trust and explainability are critical.

4. Practical Implications

From a practical standpoint:

Binder content is the primary driver of compressive strength across all modeling approaches

Aggregate composition and density play secondary but significant roles

Pozzolan influence may be nonlinear or context-dependent and warrants further investigation

These insights can inform both data-driven mix optimization and engineering decision-making.

5. Summary of Findings

In summary:

Ensemble machine learning models significantly outperform linear baselines for compressive strength prediction

Interpretability is preserved through consistent feature importance analysis

Machine learning can enhance predictive accuracy without sacrificing engineering insight

This establishes a compelling case for the adoption of ensemble ML models in concrete material analysis.
